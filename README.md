# Numerical methods in fortran
Solving linear, nonlinear equations, ordinary differential equations, ... using numerical methods in fortran

## 1. Linear equations:
    ** LU **
    ** PLU (TODO) **
    ** QR (TODO) **

## 2. No linear equations
    ** Newton-Raphson **
    ** fix-ponit (TODO) **

## 3. Ordinary differential equations
    ** Runge-Kutta (4th order) **
